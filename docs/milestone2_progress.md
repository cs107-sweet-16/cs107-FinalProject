# Milestone 2

## Progress Update

This past week we have focused on writing some basic code for the 
project and discussing future directions. The former includes 
coding our `dualNumber` class. This class will override native 
python functions in order to apply them to dual numbers (e.g. 
addition, division). These function can be found in 
'dualnumber.py'. To address other,  non-native elementary functions 
(e.g. sinusoidal), we have begun to write independent class 
statements using numpy. These can be found in 'operators.py'. For 
each operation, we have included test functions in the respective 
files. These will eventually be moved out into their own testing suite. 

Next week, we plan on implementing a forward class, through which 
we will simultaneously structure a computational class. We plan on 
achieving this through and ordered dictionary. As an additional 
component to our project, we hope to also implement reverse pass 
by utilizing the computational graph created in the forward pass. 

### Group member assignments
Bhawesh and Anna have been assigned the task to complete writing 
basic operations and elementary functions for milestone 2. We 
will also be writing the test cases for those operators and functions.
