# Milestone 2

## Progress Update

### Bhawesh Kumar
I have been assigned the task to write basic operations and
elementary functions for the milestone 2. I will also be writing
the test cases for those operators and functions.

After submission of milestone 1, I have brainstormed ideas with
the group members for the direction of the project. Specifically,
we have discussed how to implement the basic autodiff function.
I have also worked on implementing basic arithmetic operations and
functions for milestone 2.
