    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation is an important operation in scientific research broadly\n",
    "applied in non-linear optimization problems and numerical solution of\n",
    "differential equations. Recently, the development of machine learning\n",
    "techniques including artificial neural networks also require large amount of\n",
    "gradient computation. For complex functions whose analytical derivative\n",
    "expressions are difficult to obtain, one traditional option to calculate its\n",
    "derivative is finite-difference method, but may have issues such as\n",
    "floating point errors. Automatic differentiation (AD) refers to a general way\n",
    "of computing the derivatives of functions expressed as computation graphs, with\n",
    "which the evaluation of derivatives could reach machine precision. Our autodiff\n",
    "package provides tools to calculate the derivative of any function with an\n",
    "analytic expression based on the AD technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "AD mainly makes use of two properties of closed-form functions:\n",
    "1. Any closed-form function is a combination (sum, product, quotient or compound) of\n",
    "elementary functions, and the analytical expressions of the derivatives of\n",
    "elementary functions are already-known.\n",
    "2. Derivative rules including sum rule, product rule, quotient rule and most importantly, the chain rule.\n",
    "- sum rule: $(f+g)’ = f’+g’$\n",
    "- product rule: $(f\\times g)’ = f’g+g’f\\times g$\n",
    "- quotient rule: $(f/g)’ = (f’g-g’f)/(g\\times g)$\n",
    "- chain rule: $h = f(g(•))$, then $h’ = f’(g(•))× g’(•)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the value of a complicated function expression, we need to start with\n",
    "independent variables and evaluate a series of intermediate results and finally\n",
    "reach the final result. The idea of AD is to use a computational graph to\n",
    "represent the function where each node represents an intermediate variable and\n",
    "only elementary operations are carried out between intermediate variables. Because we\n",
    "utilize the operation rules of derivatives mentioned above, the derivative at any\n",
    "node in the computation graph can only rely on its parent node(s). As a result, we\n",
    "obtain the final derivative result by computing derivatives and repeatedly utilizing\n",
    "derivative rules following the flow of the computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give a brief example to illustrate how we calculate derivatives \n",
    "based on compution graph. If we want to evaluate the derivative with respect \n",
    "to x1 at x1=pi/2 for function f=sin(cos(x1)), here is our computation graph\n",
    "\n",
    "![comp graph](fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we follow the graph and evaluate step by step:\n",
    "|step| trace | Elementary function |Current value | Elementary function derivative| $\\nabla_x$ value|\n",
    "|--|--|--|--|-- |--|\n",
    "|1|v0|x|pi/2|$\\dot x$|1|\n",
    "|2|v1|cos(v0)|0|$-sin(v_0)\\dot v_0$|0|\n",
    "|3|f|sin(v1)|0|$cos(v_1)\\dot v_1$|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we calculate \"elementary function derivative\", we made use of the chain rule. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution \n",
    "We will used PyPI to distribute our package.   \n",
    "We will used a library called `twine` to help us package and distribute our\n",
    "package over PyPI. We will follow this helpful tutorial\n",
    "https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/, provides a detailed\n",
    "guide on how to setup the structure. Using a framework may be helpful,\n",
    "but in an effort to reduce software overhead and maximize learning for each\n",
    "step, we will elect to forgo a framework. Users may install autodiff (?? is this the name) through the following command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install autodiff--aabj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a python terminal, you can then import the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import autodiff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, to pull commmon functions directly you may use the following import statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from autodiff.node import variables, sin, cos, tan, exp, ln, log, sinh, cosh, tanh, sqrt, logistic, log_ab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In adition to pip installation, you may clone directly from the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/cs107-sweet-16/cs107-FinalProject.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful cloning of the repository, follow by installing the package requirements from the ‘requirements.txt’ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd cs107-FinalProject\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, finish by importing dualnumber and it’s operators\n",

    "## Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Autodiff executes auto-differntiation by utilizting the concept of a computational graph. This graph is constructed during the execution of a forward pass. Simultaneously, the final value, and the respective gradient of each variable are also computed. Forward mode may be passed on some simple user-defined function, e.g. $$ f = 3x + 5^y $$. The computational graph is constructed via Python's native operator precedence and an ordered dictionaries. As each step is executed per Python's operator precedence, the respective values and derivatives are stored within the dictionary. The code for this may be found under the directory `autodiff/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Mode Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow for this project consists of the following:\n",
    "1. Determining some function of interest\n",
    "2. Initializing each unique variable \n",
    "3. Defining the function\n",
    "4. Setting the variable values\n",
    "5. Executing forward mode\n",
    "6. Executing reverse pass\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that may of these steps must be defined in order. Particularly the following two considerations:\n",
    "1. The variables must be set as nodes prior to function definition. This ensures that as the function is execute the values will be simultaneously calculated and the computational graph will be constructed.\n",
    "2. Forward mode is executed prior to reverse mode. For reverse() to be completed, the gradients at each node and the final gradient must be computed beforehand, through forward(). Otherwise, reverse() fails.\n",

When an elementary function is called on `Node` instances, it will generate a new `Node` as the parent of the input `Node` instances, record the function or operation that should be implemented on the two input `Node`s in the new `Node`, and return the new `Node`. If a `Node` is calculated with a constant `float` or `int` input, the constant will be converted to a constant node in the computational graph. The returned `Node` can be considered as an intermediate variable in the computational graph. Therefore, during the process of using elementary functions on `Node`s to construct the complex function expression we want to calculate, we obtain a computational graph representing this function.\n",

    "### Improving API\n",
    "In future, we would like to incorporate improved API for vector inputs. Currently, the user needs to define\n",
    "all functions for vector inputs. While this can't be done away in cases where there are multiple independent output functions f: $R^{n}$  → $R^{m}$, we can improve the user interface for cases where the output function is same for each of the output dimentions m. For example, currently calulating `sin(v)` for vector input `v` requires user to define a function for each output nodes which are all sine function. A better improved API could do away with that requirement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hessian has many important application across various problems in science and engineering. For example, it is used in approximating functions as polynomial with higher precision in the Taylor Series expansion. Several interesting mathemetical property of functions like infelection points and determination of function curvature require calculating the second derivative of the function. Many optimaization functions in deep learning (for example, Newton's method) require computing Hessian function.\n",

    "To add Hessian function support in our package, we would need to change the existing implementation of reverse mode to support computational graph as an input to it. Hessian can be then calculated by a reverse mode applied on the compuational graph of the gradient calculate in the forward mode. In essence, this is equivalent to forward mode computation followed by reverse mode. Implementing Hessian is computationally expensive in terms of time and space requiremnts ($O(n^2)$ in both.) There are numerical methods to compute approximations for Hessians functions using quasi-Newton methods, that are more efficient.\n"
