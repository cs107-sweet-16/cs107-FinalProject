    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation is an important operation in scientific research broadly\n",
    "applied in non-linear optimization problems and numerical solution of\n",
    "differential equations. Recently, the development of machine learning\n",
    "techniques including artificial neural networks also require large amount of\n",
    "gradient computation. For complex functions whose analytical derivative\n",
    "expressions are difficult to obtain, one traditional option to calculate its\n",
    "derivative is finite-difference method, but may have issues such as\n",
    "floating point errors. Automatic differentiation (AD) refers to a general way\n",
    "of computing the derivatives of functions expressed as computation graphs, with\n",
    "which the evaluation of derivatives could reach machine precision. Our autodiff\n",
    "package provides tools to calculate the derivative of any function with an\n",
    "analytic expression based on the AD technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "AD mainly makes use of two properties of closed-form functions:\n",
    "1. Any closed-form function is a combination (sum, product, quotient or compound) of\n",
    "elementary functions, and the analytical expressions of the derivatives of\n",
    "elementary functions are already-known.\n",
    "2. Derivative rules including sum rule, product rule, quotient rule and most importantly, the chain rule.\n",
    "- sum rule: (f+g)’ = f’+g’\n",
    "- product rule: (f\\*g)’ = f’g+g’f\\*g\n",
    "- quotient rule: (f/g)’ = (f’g-g’f)/(g×g)\n",
    "- chain rule: h = f(g(•)), then h’ = f’(g(•))× g’(•)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the value of a complicated function expression, we need to start with\n",
    "independent variables and evaluate a series of intermediate results and finally\n",
    "reach the final result. The idea of AD is to use a computational graph to\n",
    "represent the function where each node represents an intermediate variable and\n",
    "only elementary operations are carried out between intermediate variables. Because we\n",
    "utilize the operation rules of derivatives mentioned above, the derivative at any\n",
    "node in the computation graph can only rely on its parent node(s). As a result, we\n",
    "obtain the final derivative result by computing derivatives and repeatedly utilizing\n",
    "derivative rules following the flow of the computation graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give a brief example to illustrate how we calculate derivatives \n",
    "based on compution graph. If we want to evaluate the derivative with respect \n",
    "to x1 at x1=pi/2 for function f=sin(cos(x1)), here is our computation graph\n",
    "\n",
    "![comp graph](fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we follow the graph and evaluate step by step:\n",
    "|step| trace | Elementary function |Current value | Elementary function derivative| $\\nabla_x$ value|\n",
    "|--|--|--|--|-- |--|\n",
    "|1|v0|x|pi/2|$\\dot x$|1|\n",
    "|2|v1|cos(v0)|0|$-sin(v_0)\\dot v_0$|0|\n",
    "|3|f|sin(v1)|0|$cos(v_1)\\dot v_1$|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we calculate \"elementary function derivative\", we made use of the chain rule. \n",

    "# How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "#\n",
    "### Distribution \n",
    "We will used PyPI to distribute our package.   \n",
    "We will used a library called `twine` to help us package and distribute our\n",
    "package over PyPI. We will follow this helpful tutorial\n",
    "https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/, provides a detailed\n",
    "guide on how to setup the structure. Using a framework may be helpful,\n",
    "but in an effort to reduce software overhead and maximize learning for each\n",
    "step, we will elect to forgo a framework. Users may install autodiff (?? is this the name) through the following command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install autodiff--aabj\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a python terminal, you can then import the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import autodiff as autodiff\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, to pull commmon functions directly you may use the following import statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from autodiff.node import sin, cos, tan, exp, ln, log, sinh, cosh, tanh, sqrt, logistic, log_ab, valNode\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "In adition to pip installation, you may clone directly from the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/cs107-sweet-16/cs107-FinalProject.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful cloning of the repository, follow by installing the package requirements from the ‘requirements.txt’ file.\n",

    "cd cs107-FinalProject\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Autodiff executes auto-differntiation by utilizting the concept of a computational graph. This graph is constructed during the execution of a forward pass. Simultaneously, the final value, and the respective gradient of each variable are also computed. Forward mode may be passed on some simple user-defined function, e.g. $$ f = 3x + 5^y $$. The computational graph is constructed via Python's native operator precedence and an ordered dictionaries. As each step is executed per Python's operator precedence, the respective values and derivatives are stored within the dictionary. The code for this may be found under the directory `autodiff/`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Mode Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The general workflow for this project consists of the following:\n",
    "1. Determining some function of interest\n",
    "2. Initializing each unique variable \n",
    "3. Defining the function\n",
    "4. Setting the variable values\n",
    "5. Executing forward mode\n",
    "6. Executing reverse pass\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that may of these steps must be defined in order. Particularly the following two considerations:\n",
    "1. The variables must be set as nodes prior to function definition. This ensures that as the function is execute the values will be simultaneously calculated and the computational graph will be constructed.\n",
    "2. Forward mode is executed prior to reverse mode. For reverse() to be completed, the gradients at each node and the final gradient must be computed beforehand, through forward(). Otherwise, reverse() fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "  # testing cos(ab/c) + c*log(a), a = 4, b = -1, c = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "  # initialize the nodes as variables\"\n",
    "  a = valNode('a')\n",
    "  b = valNode('b')\n",
    "  c = valNode('c')\n",
    "\n",
    "  # define the function:\n",
    "  f = cos((a * b) / c) + c * log(a)\n",
    "  a.set_val(4)\n",
    "  b.set_val(-1)\n",
    "  c.set_val(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # execute forward:\n",
    "  f_val, f_grad = f.forward()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " # print the values of interest:\n",
    " print(\"value of function f: \", f_val)\n",
    " print(\"gradient with respect to a: \", f_grad[a])\n",
    " print(\"gradient with respect to b: \", f_grad[b])\n",
    " print(\"gradient with respect to c: \", f_grad[c])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward and Reverse Mode Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLE 2 with reverse mode:\n",
    " # declare a as node\n",
    "  a = valNode('a')\n",
    " # set a's value\n",
    "  a._set_val(1.731)\n",
    "\n",
    " # set function f: a^2 + 3^a + (5/1) + a/2\n",
    "  f = a**2 + 3**a + 5/a + a/2\n",
    "\n",
    " # execute forward pass\n",
    "  f.forward_pass()\n",
    "  f_val, f_grad = f.reverse(1, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    " # print the values of interest:\n",
    " print(\"value of function f: \", f_val)\n",
    " print(\"gradient at of a (1,1): \", f_der)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to our node.py file, which contains code for forward and reverse passes on a given function, we also have more rudimentary code that constructs dual numbers and conducts a forward pass. These files are: `Dualnumber.py` and `Operatorsfunc.py`. Both of which can be found along within the `autodiff/` diretory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is similar to the previous code, except there is no reverse pass available, and the forward pass executes automatically when a function is passed. Examples below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# set dual number 'x'\n",
    "# first value (np.pi) is the real part at which we want to calculate the derivative and value of the function\n",
    "# second value '1' is the dual part. In this case it is set to one, and will default to 1, but there is an option to change it. \n",
    "x = Dualnumber(np.pi, der=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Next implement your function, by substituting in the defined dual number:\n",
    "f = (tan(x)) - 2 ** x * exp(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The forward pass has now been executed and we can check the value of the function and it's derivative:\n",
    "# value of the function: \n",
    "print(f.val) # should equal approx -204.2160993\n",
    "# value of the derivative:\n",
    "print(f.der) # should equal approx -344.76791290283\n",

When an elementary function is called on `Node` instances, it will generate a new `Node` as the parent of the input `Node` instances, record the function or operation that should be implemented on the two input `Node`s in the new `Node`, and return the new `Node`. The returned `Node` can be considered as an intermediate variable in the computational graph.
